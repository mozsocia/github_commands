git reset ---hard <commit\_hash>


1 / 1

The `git reset --hard <commit_hash>` command is used to reset the current branch to the specified commit and discard any changes made after that commit. Here's how it works:

1.  Replace `<commit_hash>` with the hash of the commit you want to reset to. This can be a full hash or a shortened version of it (typically the first 7-8 characters are enough to identify the commit).
2.  When you run the command, Git moves the current branch pointer to the specified commit, and updates the index and working directory to match the state of that commit.
3.  Any changes made after the specified commit are discarded, meaning they will be permanently lost and cannot be recovered.

It's important to use this command with caution, as it can cause data loss. Make sure to save any changes you want to keep before running this command. If you're unsure about the consequences of running this command, you can use the `git reflog` command to view the history of the branch and identify the commit you want to reset to.
