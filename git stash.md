Git stash is a useful command in Git that allows you to temporarily save changes that you have made to your working directory and store them in a "stash" without committing them to a branch. This can be handy when you need to switch branches or work on a different task without committing incomplete changes. Here are some details about Git stash:

1.  Stashing Changes: To stash your changes, you can use the following command:

```
git stash

```

This will take all the modifications in your working directory—both staged and unstaged—and save them as a new stash. Git will revert your working directory to the state of the last commit.

2.  Stash Message: You can provide an optional message with your stash to describe the changes you are stashing:

```
git stash save "Your stash message"

```

This message can be helpful for later reference when you have multiple stashes.

3.  Multiple Stashes: Git allows you to create multiple stashes. Each stash is assigned a unique identifier, starting with "stash@{0}" for the first stash, "stash@{1}" for the second, and so on.
    
4.  Viewing Stashes: To see the list of stashes you have created, you can use:
    

```
git stash list

```

It will show you the stash identifiers and their corresponding messages.

5.  Applying a Stash: To apply the changes from a stash back to your working directory, you can use either of the following commands:

```
git stash apply           # Applies the changes without removing the stash
git stash pop             # Applies the changes and removes the stash

```

By default, the latest stash (stash@{0}) will be applied. If you want to apply a specific stash, you can provide the stash identifier as an argument, like `git stash apply stash@{2}`.

6.  Discarding a Stash: If you no longer need a stash, you can discard it using:

```
git stash drop stash@{2}  # Discards the specified stash

```

This will remove the stash and its changes irreversibly. Be careful when discarding stashes.

7.  Partial Stash: Git also allows you to stash only specific changes or files using:

```
git stash save --patch    # Interactively select changes to stash
git stash push -m "Partial stash" path/to/file    # Stashes only the changes in the specified file

```

The `--patch` option initiates an interactive patch mode where you can choose which changes to stash.

8.  Stashing Untracked Files: By default, Git does not stash untracked files. However, you can use the `--include-untracked` or `-u` option with `git stash save` to include them in the stash.
    
9.  Stash Branching: Stashes are not tied to any specific branch. You can switch branches, create new ones, or even apply stashes in a different branch from where they were created.
    
10.  Conflict Resolution: If conflicts arise when applying a stash, Git will mark the conflicting files and allow you to resolve the conflicts manually. After resolving the conflicts, you can use `git stash drop` to remove the stash.
    

Git stash is a powerful command that helps you manage your work effectively by allowing you to store changes temporarily and retrieve them later as needed.


apply a specific stash

To apply a specific stash in Git, you can use the `git stash apply` command followed by the stash identifier. Here's the syntax:

```
git stash apply <stash>

```

Replace `<stash>` with the identifier of the stash you want to apply. Stash identifiers typically follow the format `stash@{n}`, where `n` is a number indicating the stash's position in the stash list.

For example, to apply the stash with the identifier `stash@{2}`, you would run:

```
git stash apply stash@{2}

```

Keep in mind that applying a stash does not remove it from the stash list. If you want to remove the stash after applying it, you can use the `git stash drop` command followed by the stash identifier:

```
git stash drop stash@{2}

```

This will remove the specified stash from the stash list. If you don't specify a stash identifier, `git stash drop` will remove the most recent stash (`stash@{0}`) by default.

Remember to carefully review any conflicts that may arise when applying the stash and resolve them appropriately.
